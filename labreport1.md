# Using cd, ls and cat in different situations
1. When using the three different commands with no arguments

   - In the first part of the image, where cd is used, nothing is output because it changes the directory to the one specified and doesn't have an output.  Because nothing was specified when using 'cd' the directory was not changed.
   - In the second part of the image where ls is used, "lecture1" is printed out.  When 'ls' is used it shows the files and folders that are in the current working directory, which in this case is "lecture1".
   - And in the final part where 'cat' is used, nothing is printed out.  This is because cat can be used to show the contents of the specified file which in this case is unspecified, so when run doesn't do anything.
